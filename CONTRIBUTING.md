## How to contribute to Original Birds

---

### Are you a legacy verified Twitter user missing your checkmark?

Itâ€™s possible that we have holes in our verified users list. As mentioned on our [website](https://chromestone.github.io/OriginalBirds/), we are not a verification business. However, if you believe you have sufficient proof such as a Wayback Machine link (**more than a screenshot**), then email us at "open.birds.official _at_ gmail _dot_ com" with "Original Birds Data Rectification" in the subject line.

### Did you find a bug?

* Do **not** open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a **security vulnerability**. Refer to our [security policy](SECURITY.md).

Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and **steps** to reproduce the error or a **screenshot/video** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report template to create the issue.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

* Cosmetic changes to popup.html are welcome and encouraged.

* Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Original Birds will generally not be accepted.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Ensure the feature was **not already requested** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds/issues).

* Fork this repository and make changes.

* When you are finished with your changes, create a pull request (include your Twitter handle in the comments). Don't forget to test your modified extension!
