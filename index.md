# Original Birds

Original Birds is a browser extension that brings back the **legacy Twitter verified checkmarks**!!!

## FAQ

**Q: How do you determine who was legacy verified?**<br />
A: Users will see a green checkmark by OBs who were legacy verified around April 6th, 2023. This means that @verified at one point followed them on Twitter. We sourced our data from [thansen0](https://github.com/thansen0/verified_twitters). Please show them some love!

**Note:** We are currently cross-referencing Twitter handles (because it would be costly to verify against the actual Twitter ID). We recognize that Twitter handles may have changed and will be working on it when we have the resources.

**Q: Can I be added to this list?**<br />
A: As of right now we're only planning on this to be a static list (like a Wayback Machine). If we were to implement our own user verification then it would require volunteers or some external funding, which would 100% draw the ire of Twitter.

Of course, you can always donate to us at the link above and get recognition! (Just be sure to give us your Twitter handle.)

**Q: I found a bug. How do I report it?**<br />
A: Please report any bugs to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds/issues). Since, this is still a work in progress, don't hesitate to create an issue if checkmarks are missing! You can of course reach out to us on our email listed on the Chrome Web Store. However, for sanity purposes we request you stick to GitHub issues.
