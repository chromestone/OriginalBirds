# Original Birds

Original Birds is a browser extension that brings back the **legacy Twitter verified checkmarks**!

Tired of not knowing who was an Original Bird (**OB**)? Then this extension is for you! A **green checkmark** is added on Twitter to indicate who was an **OB** before the great purge of April 20th, 2023.

## FAQ

<details>
	<summary><b>How do you determine who was legacy verified?</b></summmary>
	<p>Users will see a green checkmark beside OBs who were legacy verified before April 6th, 2023. This means that @verified followed them on Twitter at the time of data collection. We sourced our data from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/thansen0/verified_twitters">thansen0</a>. Please show them some love!</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> We are currently only comparing Twitter handles (because it would be costly to verify against the actual Twitter ID). We recognize that Twitter handles may have changed and will be working on it when we have the resources.</p>

**Q: Why is my browser randomly visiting Elon Musk's Twitter page?**<br />
A: This is a normal operation to retrieve Twitter's checkmark that happens once on installation. Since Elon Musk owns Twitter, he is always verified and we obtain Twitter's checkmark from his page after installation. Our extension does not include any Twitter source code or assets to avoid copyright issues.

**Q: Why do I need to grant permission to access data on Twitter?**<br />
A: We access Twitter websites to read user handles in order to check if they are verified and write HTML to add checkmarks. We don't collect any user data. If you are concerned about privacy check out our [privacy policy](privacy.md) or install from our open source [GitHub repository](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds).

**Q: Can I be added to the legacy verified list?**<br />
A: As of right now we're only planning on this to be a static list (like a Wayback Machine). If we were to implement our own user verification then it would require volunteers or some external funding, which would 100% draw the ire of Twitter.

Of course, you can always donate to us at the link above and get recognition! (Just be sure to give us your Twitter handle.)

**Q: I was a legacy verified user and I don't see a green checkmark anywhere. Can I be added?**<br />
A: It's possible that we have holes in our verified users list. As mentioned before, we are not intending to become a verification service. However, if you believe you have sufficient proof (more than a screenshot) such as a Wayback Machine link, then reach out to us at our email listed on the Chrome Web Store.

Please do not create a GitHub issue in this case. For bugs, please see below.

**Q: I found a bug. How do I report it?**<br />
A: Please report any bugs to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds/issues). Since, this is still a work in progress, don't hesitate to create an issue if checkmarks are missing! You can of course reach out to us at our email listed on the Chrome Web Store. However, for sanity purposes we request you stick to GitHub issues.

For non-GitHub users we're accepting bug reports on our Twitter [@RealOpenBirds](https://twitter.com/RealOpenBirds).

See below about contributing a patch to fix a bug.

**Q: How do I become a contributor?**<br />
A: Always consult the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and make a GitHub issue first. Remember to include your Twitter handle when you make your pull request. If it gets approved, then congrats, you're a contributor!

(Discord for donors and contributors coming soon.)
