# Original Birds

Original Birds is a browser extension that brings back the **legacy Twitter verified checkmarks**!!!

Tired of not knowing who was an Original Bird (**OB**)? Then this extension is for you! A **green checkmark** is added on Twitter to indicate who was an **OB** before the great purge of 2023.

## FAQ

**Q: How do we determine who was legacy verified?**<br />
A: Users should see a green checkmark by OBs who were legacy verified around April 6th, 2023. We sourced our data from [thansen0](https://github.com/thansen0/verified_twitters). Please show them some love!

**Note:** We are currently cross-referencing Twitter handles (because it would be costly to verify against the actual Twitter ID). We recognize that Twitter handles may have changed and will be working on it when we have the resources.

**Q: Can I be added to this list?**<br />
A: As of right now we're only planning on this to be a static list (like a Wayback Machine). If we were to implement our own user verification then it would require volunteers or some external funding, which would 100% draw the ire of Twitter.

Of course, you can always donate to us at the link above and receive a perk when it gets implemented (TBD)!

**Q: I found a bug. How do I report it?**<br />
A: Please report any bugs to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chromestone/OriginalBirds/issues). You can of course reach out to us on our email listed on the Chrome Web Store. However, for sanity purposes we request you stick to GitHub issues.
